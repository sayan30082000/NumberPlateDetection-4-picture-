# NumberPlateDetection(4-picture)

#Overview
This project demonstrates a simple approach to detect and recognize number plates from images using traditional image processing techniques with OpenCV and optical character recognition (OCR) with EasyOCR. Unlike machine learning models that require extensive datasets and training, this method relies on image manipulation to isolate the number plate and then extract the text directly.

The project is implemented in Python and is designed for a straightforward, rule-based detection process suitable for basic number plate identification.

#How it Works
The core idea behind this project involves a series of image processing steps to isolate the number plate area, followed by OCR to read the characters. The process can be broken down as follows:


#To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

opencv-python
matplotlib
numpy
imutils
easyocr
